FeedSpider2
===========

This is a port of the Mojo-based FeedSpider RSS client to the Enyo 2 Javascript Framework. Well, technically it's a port. It's really a significant re-write, especially of the UI layer.

Using the Enyo 2 Framework, FeedSpider has been ported to FireFox OS, and is currently in the process of being re-ported to webOS, and later to LuneOS, with further versions to follow.

Feedspider Supports:

* BazQux Reader
* Feedly
* InoReader
* NextCloud News
* Tiny Tiny RSS
* The Old Reader

Now, webOS and Firefox OS users can again sync their RSS feeds across all of their webOS and Firefox OS devices!
